# FastSLAM
**Authors: Dexter Duckworth, Alex Lalejini, Brandon Odom**

### Motivation
This goal of this project is to learn about localization and mapping techniques be implementing the FastSLAM algorithm in ROSpy. FastSLAM was chosen over the standard EKF SLAM implementation in order to support a larger set of landmarks and to minimize odometry induced uncertainty.

More information on the implementation of the project can be found on the wiki [here](https://github.com/dexterduck/fastslam/wiki).
